ASP.MVC
=======

Status:
- Active

Used technologies:
- C#
- ASP.MVC
- Web API?
- WCF?
- AJAX?
- LINQ?

Used design patterns:
- MVC
- DAO?

Aim:

Primary goal is to design and implement highly dynamic
and well separated (aspect paradigm) ASP.MVC web page.
Probably it'll use Web API. Emphasis will be on layer 
separation and asynchronous data loading because 
these two aspects caused serious issues in projectsI've 
been working with. Prospective profit is ASP.MVC mastering.

Secondary goal is high quality data layer design. Probably
DAO design pattern will be used. The plan is to allow
dynamic change between data sources - ultimately XML
and SQL. Prospective profit is LINQ (to XML and to SQL)
mastering. DAL should be accessible through some kind of
proxy, for examle mentioned Web API, but maybe simple
WCF web service.
