ASP.MVC
=======

Status:
- Active

Used technologies:
- C#
- ASP.MVC
- Web API?
- AJAX?
- LINQ?

Aim:

Goal is to design and implement highly dynamic
and well separated (aspect paradigm) web page
implemented in ASP.MVC. Probably it'll use Web API.
Emphasis will be on layer separation and asynchronous
data loading because these two aspects caused serious
issues in projectsI've been working with.
