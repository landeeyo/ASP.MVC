ASP.MVC
=======

Status:
- Active

Used technologies:
- C#
- ASP.MVC
- Web API?
- AJAX?
- LINQ?

Aim:

Goal is to design and implement highly dynamic
and well separated (aspect paradigm) ASP.MVC web page
Probably it'll use Web API. Emphasis will be on layer 
separation and asynchronous data loading because 
these two aspects caused serious issues in projectsI've 
been working with.
